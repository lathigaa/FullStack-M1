                        <li> The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you must be between the age of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. NYSL is ran by a small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and previous league members. </li>
